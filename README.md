# calories-burnt-prediction-app
This is a machine learning-based web app built using Streamlit that predicts the number of calories burnt based on various input factors like age, weight, height, and exercise details. The app uses a Random Forest Regressor model for accurate predictions.

Features
Predicts calories burnt based on user inputs.
Simple and interactive UI built with Streamlit.
Uses a trained Random Forest Regressor model.
Fast and efficient predictions.

Tech Stack
Python 
Streamlit (for UI)
Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)
Scikit-Learn (for model training)

Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing information about age, weight, height, gender, exercise duration, and corresponding calories burnt. It has been preprocessed and used to train the Random Forest Regressor for better accuracy.
